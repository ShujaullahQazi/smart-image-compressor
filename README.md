## 📖 How It Works

1. **Upload:** Drag & drop your image.
2. **Compress:** The browser's built-in canvas API redraws the image at a lower quality/resolution.
3. **Download:** The new image is converted to a Blob URL for instant download.

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- [ ] **Target File Size:** Auto-compress to exactly 20KB/50KB (For Passport/ID uploads).
- [ ] **Batch Processing:** Compress 10+ images at once.
- [ ] **Format Conversion:** Convert JPG to WebP automatically.
